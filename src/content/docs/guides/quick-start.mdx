import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This is a quick start guide to getting a SuperWeb theme up and running on the internet. This is intended for users already familiar with working with Astro projects. If you prefer a more in-depth guide, see [this tutorial](../tutorial/0-introduction).

:::note
Developing locally is recommended but if you prefer to try out the theme in a browser you can use an online development environment. There are many options available, including [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and [Google's Project IDX](https://idx.google.com/).
:::

## Download the code

### Using git

<Steps>

1. On the theme's GitHub page, click the green "Code" and copy the `HTTPS URL`.

2. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash frame="code" title="~/Downloads"
   # replace HTTPS_URL with the copied URL in step 1

   git clone HTTPS_URL my-website
   ```

3. Navigate to the theme's directory, install the dependencies, and start the development server:

   ```bash frame="code" title="~/Downloads/my-website"
   cd my-website
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser to view the website.

</Steps>

### Using a zip file

<Steps>

1. Download the zip file for a theme, either from the theme's GitHub page or from Gumroad.

2. Extract the zip file to a directory of your choice.

3. Navigate to the theme's directory, install the dependencies, and start the development server:

   ```bash frame="code" title="~/Downloads/theme-name"
   cd theme-name
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser to view the website.

</Steps>

:::caution
If you're having issues viewing your project in the browser after starting the development server, go back to the terminal where you ran the `dev` command. It will tell you whether an error occurred or if the project is being served at a different URL than [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

## Configure your development environment

See Astro's official [editor setup documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/) on how you can improve the development experience and unlock helpful features.

## Configure `astro.config.mjs`

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
// Replace with your site's URL.

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://barebones.superwebthemes.com",
});
```

## Configure metadata

To change the website's metadata, edit `src/siteConfig.ts`.

```ts frame="code" title="/src/siteConfig.ts"
export const SITE: SiteConfiguration = {
  title: "Astro Barebones",
  description: "A barebones Astro theme.",
  url: "https://barebones.superwebthemes.com",
  author: "SuperWeb Themes",
  locale: "en-US",
};
```

| Field       | Req | Description                                                 |
| :---------- | :-- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| title       | Yes | Displayed in header and browser tab. Used in SEO and RSS.   |
| description | Yes | Used in SEO and RSS.                                        |
| url         | Yes | Used in SEO and RSS.                                        |
| author      | Yes | Used in SEO and RSS.                                        |
| locale      | Yes | Used for SEO, RSS, and formatting dates. Defaults to en-US. |

<br />
<hr />

Customize the links shown in the navigation bar.

```ts frame="code" title="/src/siteConfig.ts"
export const NAV_LINKS: NavigationLinks = {
  about: {
    path: "/about",
    label: "About",
  },
  contact: {
    path: "/contact",
    label: "Contact",
  },
};
```

Each link should be an object with a path and a label, and must have a corresponding page in `src/pages`. There must be at least one link or the `Navigation.astro` component will encounter an error.

| Field | Req | Description                                        |
| :---- | :-- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| path  | Yes | The path to send the user to. Used in SEO and RSS. |
| label | Yes | The text to be used for the link. Used in SEO.     |

<br />

Customize your social media links. Add as many as you'd like.

```ts frame="code" title="src/siteConfig.ts"
export const SOCIAL_LINKS: SocialLinks = {
  email: {
    label: "Email",
    url: "mailto:info@superwebthemes.com",
  },
  github: {
    label: "GitHub",
    url: "https://github.com/superwebthemes",
  },
  discord: {
    label: "Discord",
    url: "https://discord.gg/V5MCBCsAjJ",
  }
  twitter: {
    label: "Twitter",
    url: "https://twitter.com/superwebthemes",
  },
  reddit: {
    label: "Reddit",
    url: "https://www.reddit.com/r/superwebthemes",
  },
};
```

| Field | Req | Description                                        |
| :---- | :-- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| path  | Yes | The path to send the user to. Used in SEO and RSS. |
| label | Yes | The text to be used for the link. Used in SEO.     |

## Start developing

Open `src/pages/index.astro` in your text editor and start editing. When you save the file, the page in your browser ([http://localhost:4321](localhost:4321)) will update automatically and reflect the changes you make.

## Deploying your site

Read the [deployment documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for information on deploying your site.
